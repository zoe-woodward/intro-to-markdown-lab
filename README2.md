## Creating a Directory

To **create a new directory** in the terminal, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Terminal**: You can usually find it in your system's applications menu. On a Mac, use **Command (âŒ˜)** + **Spacebar** to open Spotlight Search, then type "Terminal" and press **Enter**.


2. **Navigate to the Parent Directory**: Use the `cd` (change directory) command to go to the location where you want to create the new directory.

`cd path/to/parent/directory`

3. **Create the Directory**: Use the `mkdir` (make directory) command followed by the name of the directory you want to create.

`mkdir new-directory`

___Example:___

`mkdir my-project`
_This command creates a directory named my-project inside the current directory._

## Creating a File
To create a new file in the terminal, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Terminal**: If it's not already open, start the terminal application.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where you want to create the new file.

3. **Create the File**: Use the `touch` command followed by the name of the file you want to create.

___Example:___

`touch index.html`
_This command creates an empty file named index.html in the current directory._

## Verifying Creation
To verify that the directory and file were created successfully, you can _list_ the contents of the current directory using the `ls` command.

`ls`

**Example Output:**

_index.html  my-project_
